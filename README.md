## üßê What it means to contribute

If you‚Äôre a new open source contributor, the process can be intimidating. How do you find the right project? What if you don‚Äôt know how to code? What if something goes wrong?  

Not to worry,your contribution is valuable no matter how big or small it is. Whether it is a site refactor or a section update. or even a simpler one like READM‚Ç¨ update and issues organization.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Acknowledgement  

Once your PR is merged, you will be added to the [list of contributors](https://contributors.silkdev.com.tn/), which is yet another project that you could enhance and help maintain.

# Our Official Website

This is the official repository for our public-facing website `https://silkdev.com.tn`.  
Unlike other companies, we open sourced our official website, and encourage you to make your first contribution.


## 🧐 What it means to contribute

If you’re a new open source contributor, the process can be intimidating. How do you find the right project? What if you don’t know how to code? What if something goes wrong?  

Not to worry, your contribution is valuable no matter how big or small it is.  
Whether it is a site refactor, a section update. or even a READM€E (👈️ 🤫) update.

## 🧑‍💻 Acknowledgement  

Once your PR has been merged, you will be added to the [list of contributors](https://contributors.silkdev.com.tn/), which is yet another project that you could enhance and help maintain.
